// A demo application, showing how to create and run a RTSP client (that can potentially receive multiple streams concurrently).
//
// NOTE: This code - although it builds a running application - is intended only to illustrate how to develop your own RTSP
// client application.  For a full-featured RTSP client application - with much more functionality, and many options - see
// "openRTSP": http://www.live555.com/openRTSP/

#include "liveMedia.hh"
#include "BasicUsageEnvironment.hh"
#include "CommonDefines.h"

// Forward function definitions:
static recvHandler sendRecvFrameOnClient;
static recvHandler sendRecvFrameOnSink;

// RTSP 'response handlers':
void continueAfterDESCRIBE(RTSPClient* rtspClient, int resultCode, char* resultString);
void continueAfterSETUP(RTSPClient* rtspClient, int resultCode, char* resultString);
void continueAfterPLAY(RTSPClient* rtspClient, int resultCode, char* resultString);

// Other event handler functions:
void subsessionAfterPlaying(void* clientData); // called when a stream's subsession (e.g., audio or video substream) ends
void subsessionByeHandler(void* clientData, char const* reason);
// called when a RTCP "BYE" is received for a subsession
void streamTimerHandler(void* clientData);
// called at the end of a stream's expected duration (if the stream has not already signaled its end using a RTCP "BYE")

// Used to iterate through each stream's 'subsessions', setting up each one:
void setupNextSubsession(RTSPClient* rtspClient);

// Used to shut down and close a stream (including its "RTSPClient" object):
void shutdownStream(RTSPClient* rtspClient, int exitCode = 1);

// Define a class to hold per-stream state that we maintain throughout each stream's lifetime:
class StreamClientState {
public:
	StreamClientState();
	virtual ~StreamClientState();

public:
	MediaSubsessionIterator* iter;
	MediaSession* session;
	MediaSubsession* subsession;
	TaskToken streamTimerTask;
	double duration;
};

// If you're streaming just a single stream (i.e., just from a single URL, once), then you can define and use just a single
// "StreamClientState" structure, as a global variable in your application.  However, because - in this demo application - we're
// showing how to play multiple streams, concurrently, we can't do that.  Instead, we have to have a separate "StreamClientState"
// structure for each "RTSPClient".  To do this, we subclass "RTSPClient", and add a "StreamClientState" field to the subclass:

class HyRTSPClient : public RTSPClient {
public:
	static HyRTSPClient* createNew(UsageEnvironment& env, char const* rtspURL, recvHandler recvCallback,
		int verbosityLevel = 0,
		char const* applicationName = NULL,
		portNumBits tunnelOverHTTPPortNum = 0);

protected:
	HyRTSPClient(UsageEnvironment& env, char const* rtspURL,
		int verbosityLevel, char const* applicationName, portNumBits tunnelOverHTTPPortNum);
	// called only by createNew();
	virtual ~HyRTSPClient();

public:
	StreamClientState scs;
};

// Define a data sink (a subclass of "MediaSink") to receive the data for each subsession (i.e., each audio or video 'substream').
// In practice, this might be a class (or a chain of classes) that decodes and then renders the incoming audio or video.
// Or it might be a "FileSink", for outputting the received data into a file (as is done by the "openRTSP" application).
// In this example code, however, we define a simple 'dummy' sink that receives incoming data, but does nothing with it.

class DummySink : public MediaSink {
public:
	static DummySink* createNew(UsageEnvironment& env, recvHandler recvCallback,
		MediaSubsession& subsession, // identifies the kind of data that's being received
		char const* streamId = NULL); // identifies the stream itself (optional)

private:
	DummySink(UsageEnvironment& env, MediaSubsession& subsession, char const* streamId);
	// called only by "createNew()"
	virtual ~DummySink();

	static void afterGettingFrame(void* clientData, unsigned frameSize,
		unsigned numTruncatedBytes,
		struct timeval presentationTime,
		unsigned durationInMicroseconds);
	void afterGettingFrame(unsigned frameSize, unsigned numTruncatedBytes,
		struct timeval presentationTime, unsigned durationInMicroseconds);

private:
	// redefined virtual functions:
	virtual Boolean continuePlaying();

private:
	u_int8_t* fReceiveBuffer;
	MediaSubsession& fSubsession;
	char* fStreamId;
};

#define RTSP_CLIENT_VERBOSITY_LEVEL 1 // by default, print verbose output from each "RTSPClient"
